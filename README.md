### What it actually does or solves?
***
1. Open source framework that leverages the power of LLMs(*Large Language Models*) e.g, ChatGPT, Google BARD, LLAMA 2(*Meta*)
2. It helps us build advanced AI-powered applications.

Understanding - If your familiar with the concept of LLMs, they are usually *trained on a huge corpus of data*. So, langchain lets us integrate the ***full potential of LLMs*** to make our applications / workflows more intelligent and efficient.
